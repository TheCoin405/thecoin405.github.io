This is just a presentation "site" for me and my projects.

I've created this page to present myself and my projects. As time 
goes by this page will become larger and more advanced.
Everything I release within this project will be under either GPL or
Creative Common Licenses.

Short story about the creation of this project:
It all begun with I had the need for a public presentation 
that's easily accessed by businesses and clients.
So i created a template site from scratch and used a photo 
that I  had i my personal library to create all 
graphics (at this point) that is't code generated.
