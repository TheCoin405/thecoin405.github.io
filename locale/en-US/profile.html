            <p>Hi my name is Hans Åhlin <nobr>a.k.a: TheCoin405</nobr>, <br>
            I started at the young age of 4 and I've been active in the 
            tech-sceen since then.<br>I started learning computer logic and the principles of 
            computer programming at the age of 7.<br>
            <br>
            I am currently in the progress of moving away from the North part of Sweden,
            I'm thinking of moving back to Stockholm mostly because I miss the pace, 
            opportunities and social climate that a larger town offers.
            At the moment I'm looking for a job where I can use my knowledge, 
            develop my interest in a social environment.
            Previously, I have been a self-employed and focused on Business analyzes,
            support, service, software/system development, designing and building system solutions.
            I am more or less native to the industry, and been active since a young age, 
            being social and creative, I have the habit of presenting and finding solutions
            based on the interests and needs of the customer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Former, Gamer / Modder, which is something I'm about to resume.
            I build and design own rigs, built-in solutions.<br>
            I have been on parental leave for the last 4 years.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Briefly about myself:</h2>
            
            <p>I continued to evolve my interest for technology Since the age 
            of 4 when I got my first computer (a Mac II 1987) 
            I have continued to explore and studied different technical areas.<br>
            I am very creative when it comes to finding solutions for different needs. 
            If I do not have anything to do in my spare time, I think of different problems, 
            needs and solutions, or I'll test-out some of my ideas.<br>
            I used to run my own business but since I became a parent I had to put 
            that on ice. I felt that there weren't enough time to be able to run 
            a business and taking care of 2 and later 3 infants, so I dissolved my 
            company the fall of 2013 and went on full-time parental leave.

            <ul>
                <li>1987 - 2001</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It all started when I was around 4 years old and managed 
                        to get past the <a href="#Ref_Kiosk">kiosk
                        <span class="ttx">(1)</span></a> program on my fathers Mac II to 
                        access the games that he didn't want me to play.</li>
                        <li>Then after that, I was experimenting with various programs 
                        like <a href="#Ref_ResEdit">ResEdit<span class="ttx">(2)</span>
                        </a> and <a href="#Ref_HyperCard">HyperCard 
                        <span class="ttx">(3)</span></a> and it was during that time that 
                        I found my interest in programming / <a href="#Ref_Hacking">
                        Hacking<span class="ttx">(4)</span></a></li>
                        <li>Windows 3.11 was the first Windows system I tested, I 
                        preferred dos, basic and <a href="#Ref_Boreland">Boreland c ++
                        <span class="ttx">(5)</span></a> when it came to PC, 
                        I made my own dos script and basic programs to myself and 
                        friends mostly to handle PC games.</li>
                        <li>Same thing for Windows 95.</li>
                        <li>It wasn't before Windows 98 came as I went more 
                        or less all the way to PC / Windows, and that's also the 
                        time when I started with HTML 4.x and Visual Basic 6.</li>
                        <li>1999 was the first time i tested <a href="#Ref_Mandrake">
                        Mandrake Linux <span class="ttx">(6)</span></a> but 
                        i thought it was too buggy.</li>

                        <li>In June, the owner of the Burnout Café asked me if I could
                         create a shopping cart and design web pages because he had 
                         heard that I was interested in IT and so on, so I started 
                         working as webmaster and programmer for

                        <li>2006 The year when I burned out after about 2 years 
                        of traveling and bad sleep habits, I did not see the 
                        signals and continued because I thought it was all right as 
                        long as I sometimes rested. But eventually I collapsed and during the collapse 
                        I lost my memory and it took several months before it 
                        started to comeback. I still have fragmented memory from those years.</li>

                        retailer for Microshop AB. This to see how it was to 
                        work again and how I managed to handle stressful 
                        situations among people.</li>
                        <li>I took on several project assignments from
